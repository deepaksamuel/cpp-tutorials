// Anyline beginning with a // is called a comment line (like this one). Such lines are not seen by the computer.
// #include <iostream> includes a file called iostream which is already there somewhere in your computer. 
// the lineusing namespace std is mandatory in most of the cpp programs.
// all cpp programs will start executing the main function first and all cpp programs must contain one and only one main function. 
// the two curly brackets (one for opening and another for closing) contain the code that will be run in the main function
// cout is the function to print out some text.

// assignment(s)
// a) remove one of the curly brackets and see what happens when you compile
// b) rename main to main1 and see what happens when you compile
// c) change Hi! to Hi YOUR NAME! and see what happens when you compile.
// d) remove return statement and see what happens
// e) change the number return 0 to return -1 and see what happens
// f) remove the semi colon after the cout statement and check what happens
// g) delete the #include line and check the compile output
// h) delete the using namespace line and check the compile output
// i) In the output folder, you will find a file named 01-helloworld (without the cpp extension). Delete it and compile this file again and see what happens
