C++ tutorials (basics) for physics students of Central University of Karnataka 
by Deepak Samuel

Though I prefer python while teaching most of my courses, cpp cannot be completely ignored, especially for students who will be trained in high energy physics. I had earlier given a set of lectures at TIFR, Mumbai on C++ and ROOT but this one is more focussed on cpp only. This is aimed at students who have not had any prior experience in C++ programming. Similar to the python tutorials in my github page, I will teach most of the essentials like loops, conditionals, file I/O and then move to classes. 

To begin programming, you need a 'place' to write your code. This 'place' is called as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
I will use VS Code as the IDE for these tutorials. VS Code can be downloaded from https://code.visualstudio.com/

You will also need a compiler. I use gcc on Linux which is usually installed by default. On Windows, you can use Mingw compiler. Details of Mingw installation can be found at  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw.

All these tutorials were written on Linux but I am sure that you will not face any problems running them on Windows.
