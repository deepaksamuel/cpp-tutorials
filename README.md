C++ tutorials (basics) for physics students of Central University of Karnataka 
by Deepak Samuel

Though I prefer python while teaching most of my courses, cpp cannot be completely ignored, especially for students who will be trained in high energy physics. I had earlier given a set of lectures at TIFR, Mumbai on C++ and ROOT but this one is more focussed on cpp only. This is aimed at students who have not had any prior experience in C++ programming. Similar to the python tutorials in my github page, I will teach most of the essentials like loops, conditionals, file I/O and then move to classes.
